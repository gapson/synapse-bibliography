<h2>What can Reference Management software do for me?</h2>
<p>
Reference Management software enables you to create searchable databases, or &quot;libraries,&quot; from references you locate in a bibliographic or image database, online catalog, or from an article/book chapter. These programs also interact with Microsoft Word documents to automatically format references to create footnotes, end notes, and bibliographies in various citation styles.
